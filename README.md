## Description of the problem domain:
Meal Planning

## High-level description of application:
Thinking of an application that is designed to generate custom meal suggestions based on specific user inputs. 
Users can make an account and then input their food preferences (e.g., vegetarian, loves spicy food), any dietary
restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, nut allergy), and their macro-nutritional goals (e.g., high protein, low carb). 
In response, the system will output a curated list of meal ideas that align with the provided criteria. Additionally,
users can save their favorite meals, track their dietary intake over time, and even get ingredient lists and cooking 
instructions for each suggested meal.
