## Description of the problem domain:
Meal Planning

## High-level description of application:
Thinking of an application that will generate custom meal suggestions based on specific user inputs. 
Users can make an account and then input their food preferences (e.g., vegetarian, loves spicy food), any dietary
restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, nut allergy), and their macro-nutritional goals (e.g., high protein, low carb). 
In response, the system will output a curated list of meal ideas that meet the provided criteria. Additionally,
users can save their favorite meals and get ingredient lists and cooking instructions for each suggested meal.
We're using the EDAMAM food API which is linked below.
